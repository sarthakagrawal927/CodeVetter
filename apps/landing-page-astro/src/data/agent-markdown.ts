    `## What is CodeVetter?

CodeVetter is an execution-backed verification and evaluation system for coding agents. Its core loop is task, agent change, executable verification, evidence, and a measurable verdict. CLI, MCP, and machine-readable verification bundles are primary product surfaces; the desktop app is a local viewer.

## Does CodeVetter upload repositories to its own server?

No. CodeVetter has no hosted review backend. Repository context, review history, and product state remain on the local machine. When a user explicitly invokes an external model provider, that provider receives the request under its own policy.

## Which coding agents and model providers can it work with?

The desktop work surface can supervise installed Codex and Claude CLIs. Review supports user-configured Anthropic, OpenAI, and OpenRouter providers. Provider availability and account policy remain external to CodeVetter.

## What evidence does a review retain?

Findings can retain source anchors, command or test evidence, verification state, and portable proof exports. Missing, waived, stale, and unverified stages stay explicit rather than being presented as successful.

## Is there a public benchmark?

Yes. The public synthetic benchmark contains ${benchmark.case_count} hand-labeled cases and ${benchmark.expected_findings_total} expected findings. Its cases, labels, reviewer outputs, and scorer are published so the result can be reproduced.`
  ),
  benchmark: page(
    'AI code review benchmark for agent-written code',
    '/benchmark',
    `CodeVetter publishes a reproducible recognition benchmark for AI code review and security analysis. Its 27 synthetic cases are designed for transparent issue-type coverage and precise false-positive accounting, not as proof of performance on a large production pull request.

## How to interpret the score

- Inspect whether the corpus is synthetic or production-derived and what languages and issue classes it includes.
- Inspect whether ground truth comes from human labels, regression tests, or model judges.
- Read catch rate together with precision and false positives.
- Do not compare per-finding, per-pull-request, and per-task scores as if they were interchangeable.
- Prefer benchmarks that publish cases, outputs, scoring rules, and limitations.

CodeVetter v1 optimizes for reproducibility: every case and expected finding is published, and false positives and redundant matches count against precision. The corpus is small, mostly one finding per case, synthetic, labeled by one person, and does not measure latency or cost.

## Dataset

- ${benchmark.case_count} hand-labeled cases
- ${benchmark.expected_findings_total} expected findings
- Languages: ${benchmark.languages.join(', ')}
- Categories: ${benchmark.categories.join(', ')}
- Released: ${benchmark.released}
- License: ${benchmark.license}

## Recorded results

- CodeVetter: ${benchmarkResults.totalCaught}/${benchmarkResults.totalExpected} findings caught (${(benchmarkResults.catchRate * 100).toFixed(1)}% catch rate), precision ${benchmarkResults.precision.toFixed(3)}, F1 ${benchmarkResults.f1.toFixed(3)}
- Raw Claude baseline: ${baselineResults.totalCaught}/${baselineResults.totalExpected} findings caught (${(baselineResults.catchRate * 100).toFixed(1)}% catch rate), precision ${baselineResults.precision.toFixed(3)}, F1 ${baselineResults.f1.toFixed(3)}

Use this result as an inspectable check of known-issue recognition. Use the separate real-agent-PR evaluation work for repository-scale claims.

    `CodeVetter gives a coding agent a bounded loop for finding a local bottleneck, proposing one small experiment, and retaining it only when correctness and repeated before/after evidence agree.

## The bounded loop

1. Discover one executable local test or benchmark flow.
2. Measure repeatable timing, CPU, allocation, and memory evidence supported by that flow.
3. Diagnose source-backed bottlenecks while separating observation from inference.
4. Experiment with one bounded candidate and reject disproportionate patches.
5. Verify exact correctness and repeated before/after measurements before retaining anything.

The compact current path targets repository-owned JavaScript, Node.js, and Go tests and benchmarks. It does not turn a plausible edit, a noisy measurement, or a synthetic result into a production performance claim.`

## 2026-07-26 — Focused on executable verification

- CodeVetter now centers on proving whether coding agents completed a task correctly with reproducible runtime evidence.
- CLI, MCP, and machine-readable verification bundles are primary surfaces; the desktop app remains a local viewer.

## 2026-07-25 — Complete local verification loop

- Reviews can retain local sessions, recover managed runs, record intent closure, and produce evidence-owned artifact previews.
- A public agent-PR corpus and redacted performance receipts support reproducible regression and reliability comparisons.

## 2026-07-24 — Deterministic Review and Agent PR X-Ray

- Broad reviews cover changed files through bounded, checkpointed verification units.
- Completed reviews can export fail-closed JSON, Markdown, and self-contained offline HTML evidence.

## 2026-07-21 — Conversation-first Work

- Codex and Claude sessions gained provider-aware controls, attention states, searchable history, and safe archiving.
- A local Plan, Build, Review, Verify, Done board keeps sessions attached to repository context.`

    `CodeVetter is an execution-backed verification and evaluation system for coding agents. It determines whether an agent completed a software task correctly using reproducible runtime evidence — not another LLM opinion. The review pipeline runs locally in a native macOS app; your repository never hits a CodeVetter server.

## What it does

The core loop is: task → agent change → executable verification → evidence → measurable verdict. CodeVetter runs tests, type checks, builds, and profiling against the agent's diff, then produces a portable evidence bundle that proves whether the task is done.

## Open source

CodeVetter is open-source under the ISC license. The source lives at github.com/Codevetter/codevetter. The current Apple-silicon macOS build and updater archive are published via GitHub Releases.

## Built by

Sarthak Agrawal — AI infrastructure and product engineer. More at sarthakagrawal.dev.

## Public benchmark

CodeVetter maintains a public benchmark of reproducible verification cases, a scorer, and published results with documented limitations.`
