 * Playwright config for e2e tests.
 *
 * NOTE: tauri-driver uses the W3C WebDriver protocol, not Playwright's native
 * CDP protocol. On macOS, Tauri's WKWebView does not expose a CDP endpoint.
 *
 * The actual e2e tests in tests/e2e/ use Node's built-in test runner with
 * raw WebDriver fetch calls against tauri-driver (port 4444).
 *
 * This config exists as a placeholder for:
 * 1. Future Linux CI where WebKitGTK may support CDP
 * 2. Any Playwright-based assertions you want to run against the Vite dev server
 *    as a complement to the native app tests
